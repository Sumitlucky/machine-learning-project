# machine-learning-project
This project applies Machine Learning techniques to build and evaluate predictive models. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation using algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest. The goal is to demonstrate a complete ML workflow â€” from raw data to insights and predictions.
